## About The Project

This is an extension for JetBrains IDEs that integrates ChatGPT into your coding environment.
By leveraging the power of GPT-3, this makes it an invaluable tool for developers looking to streamline their workflow and gain a deeper understanding of the code they're working on.

## Getting Started

To get started, follow these simple steps:

### Prerequisites

In order to use the extension, you need to have a JetBrains IDE installed and the API key configured.
You can find the API key in your [User settings][api-key-url].

### Installation

The plugin is available from [JetBrains Marketplace][plugin-repo].
You can install it directly from your IDE via the `File | Settings/Preferences | Plugins` screen.
On the `Marketplace` tab simply search for `codegpt` and select the `CodeGPT` suggestion:

### API Key Configuration

After the plugin has been successfully installed, the API key needs to be configured.

You can configure the key by going to the plugin's settings via the `File | Settings/Preferences | Tools | CodeGPT`.
On the settings panel simply click on the `API key` field, paste the key obtained from the OpenAI website and click `Apply/OK`:

#### Azure OpenAI configuration
Specifically for Azure OpenAI services, you will have to input three supplementary fields:
* the `Resource Name`, which is the name of your Azure OpenAI Cognitive Services. It's the first part of the url you're provided to use the service: `https://my-resource-name.openai.azure.com/` -> use `my-resource-name`. You can find it in your Azure Cognitive Services page, under `Resource Management` -> `Resource Management` -> `Keys and Endpoints`.
* the `Deployment ID`, which is the name of your Deployment. You can find it in the Azure AI Studio, under `Management` -> `Deployment` -> `Deployment Name` column in the table.
* the `API Version`, I usually used the last non-preview version, which is currently `2023-05-15`. 
In addition to these, you need to input one of the two API Keys provided, found along with the `Resource Name`.

## Features

The plugin provides several key features, such as:

### Ask Anything

Ask anything you'd like.

### Other features

- **Conversation History** - View recent conversation history and restore previous sessions, making it easy to pick up where you left off
- **Concurrent conversations** - Chat with the AI in multiple tabs simultaneously
- **Seamless conversations** - Chat with the AI regardless of the maximum token limitations
- **Predefined Actions** - Create your own editor actions or override the existing ones, saving time rewriting the same prompt repeatedly
